        It's a cooperative game designed for 2 players, each playing on a
        separate device.<br />
        The only connection you need between each other is your voice. You can
        be in the same room or on the other part of the world, as long as you
        can hear each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        One player takes a role of a HACKER lost in the CYBERSPACE maze of a
        corporate network. Your need to move around CYBERSPACE, read the access
        codes to NAVIGATOR and find the TARGET node to hack it.

      </ul>
      <p>
        The other player takes a role of a NAVIGATOR who uses a terminal to
        decode the access codes they got from HACKER, read the map of CYBERSPACE
        and help HACKER find the way to the TARGET node.
